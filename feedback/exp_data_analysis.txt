#### GETTING FEEDBACK #####################################
I got feedback from Aly Milne, Thomas, Justin Pferdnre, and Lucy Storts

(Aly)
-I don’t know why, but I expected the scores across genres to be highest first. I don’t think you need to change anything here, just my brain being broken
-I would love to see the average rating across the genre for those same graphs (ie. 8.4 for business, 8.6 for historical) (you could apply this to all similar graphs)
-I’m a little confused by the Watchers Per Show Through the Years. Could you add more context?
-you could standardize the axes for all of the graphs in that chunk. That way people could tell easier what the spread is for different genres

(Thomas)
- order the genre popularity bar chart so the columns are descending
- could potentially make a stacked histogram for the genre vs. score

(Justin)
- I like how you start off immediately with all the questions so it gives the reader a good overview
  before diving in.
- The blog has great readability and flow and is very clear which I thought was great
- The only thing I noticed was that you could add a final summary of the data with a super basic overview of the results you saw
and if they were the same or different from what you expected. Looks really good tho 

(lucy)
- I really appreciate that you included a link to your blog because that way it is easy to find where/how you collected your data
- I like the drop down menus and the way the user gets to interact with your data. 
- Is there any way to ask for all genres to compare across all shows for the drop down menu?
- I was wondering if your data for each genre was stored in different .csv files… hopefully that makes
sense


#### MAKING REVISIONS #####################################
- I add more of an explanation on what the watchers category is
- I reordered the bar chart graphs
- I added an explanation about where the streaming services are used (why most of them are unfamiliar)
- in the conclusion add a final summary
- I didn't want to add a drop down to show scores for all genres because there are a lot of genres and that is a lot to display
