#### GETTING FEEDBACK #####################################
I got feedback from Aly Milne, Thomas, and Justin Pferdnre

-I don’t know why, but I expected the scores across genres to be highest first. I don’t think you need to change anything here, just my brain being broken
-I would love to see the average rating across the genre for those same graphs (ie. 8.4 for business, 8.6 for historical) (you could apply this to all similar graphs)
-I’m a little confused by the Watchers Per Show Through the Years. Could you add more context?
-you could standardize the axes for all of the graphs in that chunk. That way people could tell easier what the spread is for different genres

- order the genre popularity bar chart so the columns are descending
- could potentially make a stacked histogram for the genre vs. score

- I like how you start off immediately with all the questions so it gives the reader a good overview
  before diving in. The blog has great readability and flow and is very clear which I thought was great. The only thing I noticed was that you could add a final summary of the data with a super basic overview of the results you saw and if they were the same or different from what you expected. Looks really good tho
