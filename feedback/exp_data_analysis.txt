#### GETTING FEEDBACK #####################################
I got feedback from Aly Milne, J, J

    -I don’t know why, but I expected the scores across genres to be highest first. I don’t think you need to change anything here, just my brain being broken
    -I would love to see the average rating across the genre for those same graphs (ie. 8.4 for business, 8.6 for historical) (you could apply this to all similar graphs)
    -I’m a little confused by the Watchers Per Show Through the Years. Could you add more context?
    -you could standardize the axes for all of the graphs in that chunk. That way people could tell easier what the spread is for different genres
