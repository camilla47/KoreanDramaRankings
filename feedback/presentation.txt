#### DASHBOARD CREATION #############################

I started with what I had for lab 10, then adjusted from there. The first few graphics I made
with drop downs went smoothly. I looked up streamlit documentation to help with the formatting. The
only tricky part with this section was figuring out if sliders or drop downs were better, how to 
alphebetize the drop downs, and keeping the output to a manageable size.

To output the bar graphs, I originally coded them with seaborn. However, I discovered that searborn is
really finicky when you try to deploy your website. I had to change those parts of the code to just use
matplotlib. T'was a temporary set back, but I fixed it soon enough. The last two images aren't interactive
so those were straightforward. The goal for this dashboard was to keep it simple and efficient.

I got feedback from A, J, and Morgan Kurth (outside of class, expert in the field)

- I like it a lot! I think it might be more helpful to have the max # of episodes you want rather
  than the minimum, but I really like it all! That would only be for if you had to improve one thing.
  I love your Crash Landing reference page haha
- Oooo I just took a look and I love this. Im going to watch my recommended dramas over Christmas break.
  Also, interesting how Taiwanese dramas are rated the highest. Iâ€™ve never watched a Taiwanese show, but
  I for sure should
