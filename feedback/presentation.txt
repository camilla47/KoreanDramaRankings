#### DASHBOARD CREATION #############################

I started with what I had for lab 10, then adjusted from there. The first few graphics I made
with drop downs went smoothly. I looked up streamlit documentation to help with the formatting. The
only tricky part with this section was figuring out if sliders or drop downs were better, how to 
alphebetize the drop downs, and keeping the output to a manageable size.

To output the bar graphs, I originally coded them with seaborn. However, I discovered that searborn is
really finicky when you try to deploy your website. I had to change those parts of the code to just use
matplotlib. T'was a temporary set back, but I fixed it soon enough. The last two images aren't interactive
so those were straightforward. The goal for this dashboard was to keep it simple and efficient.
