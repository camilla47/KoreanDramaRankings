#### Getting Feedback ####################################
I got feedback from Garrett Springer, Aly Milne, and Joe Bradley for feedback. This is what they said:

-Typo in the first line Koran -> Korean
- I liked that you included the code snippets
- Good explanation of selenium
- Maybe some more info on your cleaning process

- I like your questions for the EDA. I think those will lead to good insights.
-Was there any sort of rate limit that you implemented while scraping the data? Like a lag between pulls?
-I also ran into issues with the stupid cookie button while I was scraping mine so I feel you on trying to click the right thing at the right time
-You did a good job! I canâ€™t wait to see what you do with the data

- Koran > Korean
- the ethical considerations header is not bolded
overall very nice, straightforward, and professional

############################################################
Afterwards, I made these changes:
- fixed typos
- made the ethical considerations header larger
- I gave an example of splitting up the country, year, and episode string into 3 separate variables
- I added an explanation for how I converted network and genre to 0s and 1s
