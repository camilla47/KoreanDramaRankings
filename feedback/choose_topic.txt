 ### CHOOSING A TOPIC #####################################

### Initial brainstorming
 There were a few topics I was interested in for this project. It was a little difficult to find something
 I was both interested in and that would have enough data to fit the requirements. Some of the areas I was
 interested in were agriculture, owls, music, and K-dramas. My family has an ongoing research project with
 owls, but I couldnt' find any good datasets to go with that. I explored the USDA website and the information 
 they had on agriculture and crops, specifically in my home state of Washington. I also looked into NASA api
 keys to potentially do something with asteroids and exoplanets. The last option I considered was analyzing
 the My Drama Lists's (MDL) website for data on K-dramas. 

### Getting Feedback
 I asked some of my classmates for their feedback on topic selection, and this is what they said:
 These were my ideas
 - Scrape information from the USDA on agriculture in Washington State 
 - Use the NASA API to analyze data on asteroids and exoplanets
 - Scrape My Drama List website for data on K-dramas

From Joe Bradley:
"I think the K-drama could be really cool. Is there a way that you can coincide the data with popularity?
Like see how popular it has become? Maybe draw some parallels to the popularity to K-pop as well."

From Garrett Springer
He said the NASA api key was difficult to use, so it might be easier to start elsewhere (unless I really wanted to do it)


### Choosing a Final Topic
 I ultimately decided to go with the K-drama project. As a K-drama fan, I was excited to create 
 visualizations for the data the MDL website has. These are some of the questions I want to look into:
 - What is the relationship between show length (number of episodes) and viewer rating?
 - Which streaming service provides shows with the highest ratings?
 - How has episode length changed over time?
 - Which genres are the most popular in different years?
